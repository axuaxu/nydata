The SWSCR dataset includes weight status data collected from all public school districts outside of the five boroughs of NYC. The dataset is a valid source of information about variation in overweight and obesity in public school districts outside of New York City.  However, because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make absolute comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county- and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code.  County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents/guardians ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data.  Use the school years variable to distinguish between the full file (which spans 2 years and includes all public school districts) and the single-year, district only file (which spans a single year and includes only the approximately 50% of public school districts that reported during that year). County, regional and statewide estimates will only be provided biennially with the full-year file. District estimates will be updated annually.

All PQIs apply only to adult populations (over the age of 18 years).

The dataset is a valid source of information about variation in overweight and obesity in public school districts outside of New York City.  However, because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make absolute comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county- and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code.  County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of: restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents/guardians ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data. o\tUse the school years variable to distinguish between the full file (which spans 2 years and includes all public school districts) and the single-year, district only file (which spans a single year and includes only the approximately 50% of public school districts that reported during that year). County, regional and statewide estimates will only be provided biennially with the full-year file. District estimates will be updated annually."

The dataset is a valid source of information about variation in overweight and obesity in public school districts outside of New York City.  However, because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make absolute comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county- and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code.  County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of: restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents/guardians ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data. o\tUse the school years variable to distinguish between the full file (which spans 2 years and includes all public school districts) and the single-year, district only file (which spans a single year and includes only the approximately 50% of public school districts that reported during that year). County, regional and statewide estimates will only be provided biennially with the full-year file. District estimates will be updated annually."

      "Notes" : "The SWSCR dataset includes weight status data collected from all public school districts outside of the five boroughs of NYC. The dataset is a valid source of information about variation in overweight and obesity in public school districts outside of New York City.  However, because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make absolute comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county- and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code.  County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of: restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents/guardians ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data.o\tUse the school years variable to distinguish between the full file (which spans 2 years and includes all public school districts) and the single-year, district only file (which spans a single year and includes only the approximately 50% of public school districts that reported during that year). County, regional and statewide estimates will only be provided biennially with the full-year file. District estimates will be updated annually. "

      "Notes" : "The SWSCR dataset includes weight status data collected from all public school districts outside of the five boroughs of NYC. The dataset is a valid source of information about variation in overweight and obesity in public school districts outside of New York City.  However, because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make absolute comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county- and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code.  County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of: restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents/guardians ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data.o\tUse the school years variable to distinguish between the full file (which spans 2 years and includes all public school districts) and the single-year, district only file (which spans a single year and includes only the approximately 50% of public school districts that reported during that year). County, regional and statewide estimates will only be provided biennially with the full-year file. District estimates will be updated annually. "

The denominators for certain indicators are small (i.e., PCP prophylaxis) because eligible populations for these indicators are reduced. The vast majority of HIV ambulatory care programs (>90%) have self‐reported their performance data and are included in this report. Blank data fields occur for three reasons: (i) if there were five (5) or fewer patients eligible for a single indicator, these data were redacted to protect confidentiality; (ii) indicators with insufficient spread are not categorized by quintile; and (iii) some fields, such as facility type, are not applicable for aggregated (regional or statewide) entries."

The view defaults to a high-level map of the Eastern United States with the entire HIVQUAL data set represented by a large red dot over New York State.  Clicking repeatedly on this dot zooms the view into New York, and as the view narrows the single dot is replaced by multiple dots that represent smaller clusters of sites.  (Red dots represent aggregated samples of 1000 or more; orange dots represent 100 to 999 patients; and yellow dots represent up to 99 patients).\r\n\r\nEach of these dots may be clicked in turn, which zooms the view into that area.  Data are eventually displayed at the level of individual clinics, which are represented by small blue dots.  Clicking on any of these generates a \"flyout\" text box that contains the program's name, its facility type, and the name, score and performance quintile for the current indicator.  Clicking \"view details for this row\" will display the entire data point in a table view below the map, including the street address for the clinic.\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to scroll through the performance for each indicator by clicking repeatedly on the \"Next\" link in the flyout, it will usually be more convenient to filter the map data to focus on a particular indicator.  This can be done by typing a portion of the indicator name in the \"Indicator Name contains\" text box to the right of the map and then checking the box just to the left of that field.  For example, filtering on \"domestic\" will limit the display to the \"Domestic violence screening\" indicator.  Additional filtering options are provided that allow for focusing on particular types of facilities (e.g., just community health centers) and/or sites that score above any desired threshold value.\r\n\r\nIn addition to common map navigation options including using the mouse to drag the view or dragging a sliding scale to zoom in or out, there is a button with an arrow and crossed lines that provides a \"navigate to here\" feature.  Entering a street address will refocus the map on that location, and the user can then zoom out to see clinics in that area.\" The \"About\" tab contains additional details concerning this dataset.", "hiv, aids, ambulatory care, outpatient, quality improvement, quality management, qi, qm, quality, consumer resources, quality-safety-costs", {

It is possible to calculate the quintile cut points displayed in this table by using the facility-level data in the NHQI data set. Calculating the overall score quintiles from the data set will result in a slight difference in the quintile values due to adjustments to some facilities’ performances. The New York State Nursing Home Quality Initiative (NHQI) is an annual evaluation and ranking of eligible Medicaid-certified nursing homes in New York State. Nursing homes are evaluated on their performance in three components: Quality, Compliance, and Efficiency. Nursing homes are awarded points for their performance in each measure and ranked into overall quintiles, the first quintile containing the best performing homes.  Refer to the Measures document to learn more about the specific measures in the NHQI, and the data sources and time frames used. Changes in measure specifications and the deletion or addition of measures will limit the ability to trend this data over time.

      "Notes" : "The participating sites in the dataset are based on approved applications to the Child and Adult Care Food Program. Applications are reviewed daily and program participation is frequently changing.  Participating programs in CACFP are child care centers, including Head Start centers, outside school hours programs serving children through age twelve in licensed or registered non-residential settings, after school programs providing educational or enrichment programming for children up to nineteen years of age in low income areas, community-based adult day care centers that are approved by federal, state or local authorities to provide day care services to functionally impaired adults through individualized care plans and home-based family and group child care.  The EWPHCCS (Eat Well Play Hard in Child Care Settings) project provides funding to implement a nutrition and physical activity curriculum designed for pre-school children and their parents. The EWPH-DCH (East Well Play Hard in Day Care Homes) project was designed as an educational and environmental change program with DCH (Day Care Home) providers as the primary target audience and the children and their parents as the secondary target audiences.   This dataset is currently updated quarterly.  "

The Potentially Preventable Readmission (PPR) software created by 3M Health Information Systems, identifies hospital admissions clinically related to an initial admission within a specified time period. For this dataset, readmissions were evaluated within a 30-day time period from the discharge date of the initial hospital admission. A PPR may have resulted from a deficiency in the process of care and treatment at the initial hospitalization or lack of post-discharge follow up. PPRs are not defined by unrelated events that occur post-discharge, such as admissions for trauma. For each hospital, the total number of at risk admissions, the total number of observed PPR chains, the observed PPR rate, the expected PPR rate, and risk adjusted PPR rate are presented by year."

Each dataset consists of county level data for 68 health tracking indicators and sub-indicators for the Prevention Agenda 2013-2017: New York State’s Health Improvement Plan.  A health tracking indicator is a metric through which progress on a certain area of health improvement can be assessed.  The indicators are organized by the Priority Area of the Prevention Agenda as well as the Focus Area under each Priority Area.  Each dataset includes tracking indicators for the five Priority Areas of the Prevention Agenda 2013-2017.  The most recent year dataset includes the most recent county level data for all indicators. The trend dataset includes the most recent county level data and historical data, where available. Each dataset also includes the Prevention Agenda 2017 state targets for the indicators. Sub-indicators are included in these datasets to measure health disparities among socioeconomic groups.

It also shows the 2017 objective. To view the chart for a different county, create a new chart under the \"Visualize\" tab. This chart is based on one of three datasets related to the Prevention Agenda Tracking Indicators county level data posted on this site. Each dataset consists of county level data for 68 health tracking indicators and sub-indicators for the Prevention Agenda 2013-2017: New York State’s Health Improvement Plan.  A health tracking indicator is a metric through which progress on a certain area of health improvement can be assessed.  The indicators are organized by the Priority Area of the Prevention Agenda as well as the Focus Area under each Priority Area.  Each dataset includes tracking indicators for the five Priority Areas of the Prevention Agenda 2013-2017.  The most recent year dataset includes the most recent county level data for all indicators. The trend dataset includes the most recent county level data and historical data, where available. Each dataset also includes the Prevention Agenda 2017 state targets for the indicators. Sub-indicators are included in these datasets to measure health disparities among socioeconomic groups.

Each dataset consists of county level data for 68 health tracking indicators and sub-indicators for the Prevention Agenda 2013-2017: New York State’s Health Improvement Plan.  A health tracking indicator is a metric through which progress on a certain area of health improvement can be assessed.  The indicators are organized by the Priority Area of the Prevention Agenda as well as the Focus Area under each Priority Area.  Each dataset includes tracking indicators for the five Priority Areas of the Prevention Agenda 2013-2017.  The most recent year dataset includes the most recent county level data for all indicators. The trend dataset includes the most recent county level data and historical data, where available. Each dataset also includes the Prevention Agenda 2017 state targets for the indicators. Sub-indicators are included in these datasets to measure health disparities among socioeconomic groups.

Each dataset includes tracking indicators for the five Priority Areas of the Prevention Agenda 2013-2017.  The most recent year dataset includes the most recent county level data for all indicators. The trend dataset includes the most recent county level data and historical data, where available. Each dataset also includes the Prevention Agenda 2017 state targets for the indicators. Sub-indicators are included in these datasets to measure health disparities among socioeconomic groups.

The orange bars represent the 95% confidence intervals. The dotted line represents the statewide percentage of adults with poor mental health for 14 or more days in the last month. The poor mental health indicator is calculated from a Health Related Quality of Life Scale included with the Expanded BRFSS. More information about the Health Related Quality of Life Scale can be found here: http://www.cdc.gov/hrqol/pdfs/mhd.pdf. The questionnaire used for the survey can be found in the attachments section under the \"About\" tab. Data from the 2013-2014 New York Expanded Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (eBRFSS) Survey were used to generate percentages of non-institutionalized adult (18+) NYS residents for 49 health indicators.  Health domains covered include: \r\n\r\nImprove health status and reducing health disparities; \r\nPromote a healthy and safe environment; \r\nPrevent chronic diseases; Prevent HIV/STDs, vaccine preventable diseases and healthcare-associated infections; \r\nPromote healthy women, infants, and children;  and\r\nPromote mental health and prevention substance abuse. \r\n\r\nPercentages for this wide range of public health metrics are provided as both unadjusted and age-adjusted rates for counties and regions. \r\n\r\nThe eBRFSS is a random digit dialing (RDD) phone survey of the health status and health behaviors of adult NYS residents. The eBRFSS is designed to provide estimates of health indicators at the county level. The sample covers 31,690 completed interviews conducted between April 2013 and March 2014.

The eBRFSS was last conducted in NYS in 2008-2009 and did not include a cell phone component. Respondents with invalid or missing responses to any question utilized in an indicator’s calculation were excluded from the numerator and the denominator of the calculation.  Health domains covered include: Improve health status and reducing health disparities;  Promote a healthy and safe environment;  Prevent chronic diseases; Prevent HIV/STDs, vaccine preventable diseases and healthcare-associated infections;  Promote healthy women, infants, and children;  and Promote mental health and prevention substance abuse. Percentages for this wide range of public health metrics are provided as both unadjusted and age-adjusted rates for counties and regions. The eBRFSS is a random digit dialing (RDD) phone survey of the health status and health behaviors of adult NYS residents. The eBRFSS is designed to provide estimates of health indicators at the county level. The sample covers 31,690 completed interviews conducted between April 2013 and March 2014.

The eBRFSS is designed to provide estimates of health indicators at the county level. The sample covers 31,690 completed interviews conducted between April 2013 and March 2014. For more information, go to:\r\n‘http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/brfss/expanded/.

      "Notes" : "The eBRFSS provides estimates of a wide range of health indicators at the county level to facilitate county-level behavioral risk factor tracking and enables counties to effectively target resources for interventions specific to the health needs of their populations. The eBRFSS was last conducted in NYS in 2008-2009 and did not include a cell phone component. Respondents with invalid or missing responses to any question utilized in an indicator’s calculation were excluded from the numerator and the denominator of the calculation."

Priority areas include Chronic Disease; Health and Safe Environment; Healthy Women, Infants and Children; Mental Health and Substance Abuse; and HIV, STDs, Vaccine Preventable Diseases and Healthcare Associated Infections.  The most recent year dataset includes the most recent state level data for all indicators. The trend dataset includes the most recent state level data and historical data, where available. Each dataset also includes the Prevention Agenda 2017 state targets for the indicators. Sub-indicators are included in these datasets to measure health disparities among racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups and persons with disabilities. For more information, check out: http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/prevention_agenda/2013-2017/. The \"About\" tab contains additional details concerning this dataset.", "prevention agenda, tracking indicator, county, community health and chronic disease, strategic initiatives", {

Health domains covered include: \r\n\r\nImprove health status and reducing health disparities; \r\nPromote a healthy and safe environment; \r\nPrevent chronic diseases; Prevent HIV/STDs, vaccine preventable diseases and healthcare-associated infections; \r\nPromote healthy women, infants, and children;  and\r\nPromote mental health and prevention substance abuse. \r\n\r\nPercentages for this wide range of public health metrics are provided as both unadjusted and age-adjusted rates for counties and regions. \r\n\r\nThe eBRFSS is a random digit dialing (RDD) phone survey of the health status and health behaviors of adult NYS residents. The eBRFSS is designed to provide estimates of health indicators at the county level. The sample covers 31,690 completed interviews conducted between April 2013 and March 2014.

A health tracking indicator is a metric through which progress on a certain area of health improvement can be assessed.  The indicators are organized by the Priority Area of the Prevention Agenda as well as the Focus Area under each Priority Area.  Priority areas include Chronic Disease; Health and Safe Environment; Healthy Women, Infants and Children; Mental Health and Substance Abuse; and HIV, STDs, Vaccine Preventable Diseases and Healthcare Associated Infections.  The most recent year dataset includes the most recent state level data for all indicators. The trend dataset includes the most recent state level data and historical data, where available. Each dataset also includes the Prevention Agenda 2017 state targets for the indicators. Sub-indicators are included in these datasets to measure health disparities among racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups and persons with disabilities.

The chart gives an indication of the ability of the HNP environmental intervention to decrease the prevalence of mice in the home.  The HNP pest control intervention involves providing products (such as traps and cleaning supplies) and educating residents about removing harborage and food for pests by storing garbage appropriately, cleaning, and repairing holes that give mice entry into the home.  In some cases, the HNP contacts local code enforcement or the landlord.\r\nWe can see that the initial visit percentages vary substantially across the across counties, which could reflect differing geography, urban versus rural target areas, and the quality of the housing stock.  Except for one county, the homes that were selected for a revisit have a lower percentage with mice homes that had an initial visit, indicating an overall reduction in the percentage of homes with mice after the HNP intervention, although mice were not eradicated from all the homes.  Oneida and Cortland Counties show no mice in the revisited homes, which could be an indication of success of the intervention and/or the selection of homes to revisit.  For Westchester County, it is possible that the homes that the revisited homes were the worst and, therefore, had a higher percentage.

Although the overall number of respondents in the BRFSS is more than sufficiently large for statistical inference purposes, subgroup analyses can lead to estimates that are unreliable.

This specific API page is for the Student Weight Status Category Reporting Results: Beginning 2010 dataset. The Student Weight Status Category Reporting System (SWSCR) collects weight status category data (underweight, healthy weight, overweight or obese, based on BMI-for-age percentile). The dataset includes separate estimates of the percent of students overweight, obese and overweight or obese for all reportable grades within the county and/or region and by grade groups (elementary and middle/high). The rates of overweight and obesity reported are percentages based on counts of students in selected grades (Pre-K, K, 2, 4, 7, 10) reported to the NYSDOH. Because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.

      "Notes" : "The SWSCR dataset includes weight status data collected from all public school districts outside of the five boroughs of NYC. The dataset is a valid source of information about variation in overweight and obesity in public school districts outside of New York City.  However, because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make absolute comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county- and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code.  County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of: restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents/guardians ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data.

      "Disclaimer" : "Although the overall number of respondents in the BRFSS is more than sufficiently large for statistical inference purposes, subgroup analyses can lead to estimates that are unreliable. Interpreting and reporting weighted numbers that are based on a small, unweighted number of respondents can mislead the reader into believing that a given finding is much more precise than it actually is. The BRFSS follows a rule of not reporting or interpreting percentages based upon a denominator of fewer than 50 respondents (unweighted sample). Both a csv and sas data files are available."

Use appropriate statistical software capable of analyzing complex sample survey data, for example SUDAAN, STATA, SAS; 6. Suppress reporting of information in instances when reliability of estimates should be considered: *One-half confidence interval is greater than 10, for asymmetric confidence intervals both the lower and upper limits exceed 10 * There are fewer than 50 observations in the denominator or less than 6 in the numerator *Relative standard error is greater than .30"
